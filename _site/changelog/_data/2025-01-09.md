**Special Notes**

- The Xenia Canary introduces GamerTags (user profiles). On first run or game launch you may be prompted to create a profile. This will sometimes migrate your saves for you. If not you can manually copy your saves from your /userdata/saves/xbox360 folder to the new profile folder which is created there. **Note:** The older Xenia version does not have this feature, therefore if you may need to transfer game saves back as necessary.
- We have migrated to a more modern WINE runner, using WINE-TKG. WINE-TKG v9.21 takes advantage of all the benefits from WINE v9.x releases for compatibility.
